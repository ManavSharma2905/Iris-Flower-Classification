Iris Flower Classification<br>
This project is a machine learning solution to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using the popular Iris dataset, the project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

Features<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to explore feature relationships.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier trained to achieve high accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Model Deployment: The trained model is saved as a .pkl file for reuse.

Technologies Used<br>
Python (v3.8+)

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is available as part of Scikit-learn’s built-in datasets.
