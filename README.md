Iris Flower Classification<br>
This project is a machine learning solution to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Using the popular Iris dataset, the project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

Features<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to explore feature relationships.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier trained to achieve high accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Model Deployment: The trained model is saved as a .pkl file for reuse.

Technologies Used<br>
Python (v3.8+)

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

The dataset is available as part of Scikit-learn’s built-in datasets.

How to Run
Prerequisites:
Install Python (v3.8 or later).

Install required libraries:

bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Steps:
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
Open the Jupyter Notebook (iris_classifier.ipynb) in your preferred environment.

Run all cells to see data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set due to the simplicity of the Iris dataset.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other algorithms like Logistic Regression or SVM.

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to further optimize performance.
