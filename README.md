# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project classifies iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal dimensions with a Random Forest Classifier. Built with Python and Scikit-learn, it covers data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation. Using the Iris dataset (150 samples), the model achieves 100% accuracy.
